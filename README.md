# Flappy Bird AI Remake

This is a remake of the code from the codebullet video that makes an AI that can play flappy bird perfectly.

The actual flappy bird clone is different from how he did it -- his video is pretty
fast and a little impossible to follow along in that aspect

I am following his process and making lots of comments along the way to try and learn about javascript, node applications, and AI.
