# Flappy Bird AI Remake

This is a remake of the code from the codebullet video that makes an AI that can play flappy bird perfectly.

The actual flappy bird clone is different from how he did it -- his video is pretty
fast and a little impossible to follow along in that aspect, but I revert it back to his method and basically copy his code from there.

This is like 0% original code, I just wanted to learn about NEAT ai and node javascript programs.
